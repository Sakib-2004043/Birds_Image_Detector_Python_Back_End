# ***Birds Image Detection***

This project is a deep learning-based application that detects the type of bird in an image with an accuracy of ***60%***. The frontend is built using ***Next.js***, while the backend is managed with ***Python***, utilizing a virtual environment.

## ***Project Overview***

- **Frontend**: Developed with ***Next.js***, providing a responsive and user-friendly interface for uploading images.
- **Backend**: Powered by ***Python***, the backend processes the images and performs the detection using a trained deep learning model.

## ***Features***

- **Image Upload**: Users can upload images directly through the web interface.
- **Real-time Detection**: Once an image is uploaded, the backend quickly processes it to determine the type of bird in the image.
- **Accuracy**: The model achieves a ***60%*** accuracy rate in distinguishing between different bird species.

## ***Technology Stack***

- **Frontend**: ***Next.js*** (React Framework)
- **Backend**: ***Python*** (within a virtual environment)
- **Deep Learning**: Trained model for image classification

## ***How to Run***

### ***Prerequisites***

- ***Node.js*** and ***npm*** installed for the frontend.
- ***Python*** and a virtual environment set up for the backend.
